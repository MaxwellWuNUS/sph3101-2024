############# Analyse your data ############# 


## Data analysis : 2 sample t-test (to compare two population means)

# Is gender associated with levels of LDL cholesterol?
t.test(chp$ldl~chp$female) 

# Is the LDL-gender association confounded by smoking status?

# ++++++++ In-class exercise ++++++++ #
# Is there a difference in the mean LDL values between smokers and non-smokers?






# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# Data analysis : Chi-square/Fisherâ€™s exact test (association between two categorical variables)

# Is the gender associated with smoking status?
tab_gender_smoker = table(chp$female,chp$smoker)
dimnames(tab_gender_smoker) = list(c('male','female'),c('non-smoker','smoker'))

# to get % in each combinations: use the "apply" function to compute column percentages
apply(tab_gender_smoker,MARGIN = 2,FUN = function(x) round(x/sum(x)*100,2))

chisq.test(tab_gender_smoker)
fisher.test(tab_gender_smoker)

# Data analysis : Investigating confounding effect

# Is the LDL-gender association confounded by smoking status?

t.test(chp$ldl[chp$smoker %in% 0]~chp$female[chp$smoker %in% 0]) 
t.test(chp$ldl[chp$smoker %in% 1]~chp$female[chp$smoker %in% 1]) 



# Data analysis : Correlation (linear association between two continuous variables)

# Is age associated with levels of LDL cholesterol?
cor.test(chp$ldl,chp$age)
# Scatter plot of LDL cholesterol and age
plot(chp$ldl~chp$age,

############# Practical ############# 

# populate table 1 inferential tests 

# ++++++++ Question 1 ++++++++ #

# 1.	Populate the t-test and pvale table 

## a) Age and CVD 


## b) BMI and CVD 


## c) LDL cholesterol and CVD 


## d) Gender and CVD 


## e) Ethnicity and CVD 


## f) Smoking status and CVD 



# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# ++++++++ Question 2 ++++++++ #

# 2.	Is BMI (being overweight) associated with CVD? 
# Populate your results in the table.






# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #


# ++++++++ Question 3 ++++++++ #

# 3.	Is smoking associated with BMI (being overweight)? 
# Populate your results in the table.






# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #


# ++++++++ Question 4 ++++++++ #

# 4.	Is smoking associated with CVD? 
# Populate your results in the table.
